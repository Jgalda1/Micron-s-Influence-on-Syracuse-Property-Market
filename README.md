# Micron-s-Influence-on-Syracuse-Property-Market
This project analyzes Microns impact on Syracuse's real estate prices. By studying prices before and after the announcement of a $20B chip plant, we can evaluate if residential real estate prices in Syracuse can lead to higher prices in the future and cause the possibility of homes becoming unaffordable for low income renters.
